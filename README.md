An android game built using Google's ARCore and TensorFlow Lite(image recognition).


### Game Modes
1. Single Player Mode : You must have played MoleMash, right? This game mode is the exact same implementation, with an element
                        of Augmented Reality. Choose your own play area and mash up the moles which get generated randomly on
                        the chosen area.

2. Multiplayer Mode : This mode enables two players to shoot each other and try to reduce each other's health. This game is                           different from the others because you get to choose your own map, build your own obstacles (using
                      Augmented Reality).
